=Solrable
A Rails plugin for easily hooking up action methods to Solr requests. An experimental, work in progress.

==Example
  class Documents < ApplicationController
  
    include Solrable::Controller
  
    # call the #search method on SolrDocument when the #index action is executed
    # this also creates the #index action as well as some other helpers.
    # controller.solr_index_params is automatically created and exposed as a view helper.
    solrize :index, :search do
      {
        :q => params[:q],
        :rows => params[:rows]
      }
    end
    
  end

===Notes
Yeah, this isn't done yet. Dependes on RSolr::Ext.
